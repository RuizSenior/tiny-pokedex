# Tiny Pokédex  

Tiny Pokédex is a small project I built a few years ago and recently found again. It uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display Pokémon data in a simple interface.  

## Features  
- Search for Pokémon by name or ID  
- View sprites, abilities, and types  
- Simple and clean design  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tiny-pokedex.git
